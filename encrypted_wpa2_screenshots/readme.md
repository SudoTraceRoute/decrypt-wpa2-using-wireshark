On these screenshots you might see how the captured wpa2 encrypted traffic looks like.
The screenshots show EAPOL 4-way handshake capture that is encrypted.
On the rest of the screenshots the other captured packets are visible, but due to encryption, the only visible porotocol beside EAPOL is 802.11
